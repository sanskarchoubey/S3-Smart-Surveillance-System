## Introduction

The **Smart Surveillance System (S3)** is an advanced AI-powered security solution designed to enhance the safety of public and private spaces. This system integrates multiple state-of-the-art features like object detection, facial recognition, mask detection, weapon identification, thief identification, and real-time video analysis. It provides automated monitoring and alerts, ensuring a proactive approach to security.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Accurately identifies and tracks objects within the surveillance area.
- **Facial Recognition**: Recognizes and verifies faces in real-time to identify individuals.
- **Mask Detection**: Detects whether individuals are wearing masks, crucial in health compliance scenarios.
- **Weapon Identification**: Identifies potential weapons and alerts security personnel.
- **Thief Identification**: Detects and alerts in case of suspicious activities that may indicate theft.
- **Real-Time Video Analysis**: Continuously analyzes video feeds to detect any anomalies or threats.
- **Alarm System**: Triggers alarms and sends immediate notifications via email when a threat is detected.
